# Mips Broth

In this repository I show some basic codes in MIPS, with:

- Loops
- Whiles
- Procedures (parameters, returns)

Some definitions will be important to understand MIPS: 
- In this language, we use instructions, which are quite basic (something defined by the engineers themselves).
- MIPS instructions have a basic structure:
    `{Command} {Destination Register}, {Register 1}, {Register 2}`

An example of code is the addition instruction:

`add $s0, $s1, $s2`

*In the codes of this repository, we have comments.
